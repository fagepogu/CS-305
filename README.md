# CS-305
Artemis Financial is a financial firm that offers financial plans to customers worldwide. Their main concern was creating a secure system for exchanging information with clients. I struggled with this part of the assignment so I'm uncertain what I did well. However, it is important to code securely because that protects the system from potential attacks where sensitive information can be compromised. The stronger the security, the more likely they are to be trusted, and this may help the firm gain more clients long-term.


The hardest part of the vulnerability assessment was getting it to run at all because of version mismatches. I had to delete the Java version I was previously using, and I had to switch to a previous version. I also had issues getting the dependency check to run from the terminal. I was able to successfully generate a certificate and launch localhost, which displayed a unique hash output. I increased the security by using the SHA-256 bit algorithm, which is a stronger security choice since the output is randomized, which guarantees nothing will be reused.


My resources did not come from a specific source. I had to do some Googling to figure out why my program wouldn't run, which included forums like Reddit, as well as some YouTube videos. In the future I could provide more screenshots of the terminal so it is clear what is happening step by step.
